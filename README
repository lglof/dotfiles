# Dotfiles

I installed the i3wm version of Manjaro recently and don't feel like losing my configuration if something goes off the rails. 

## Next steps
- polybar (I did some initial work on this, didn't go anywhere that worked better than the i3status though)
- more custom scripting (just a lil short on ideas right now)
